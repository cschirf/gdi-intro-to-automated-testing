            <ul>
              <li>
                Reliability: If your test is not reliable, then it is not giving
                you any useful information. It is dead weight.
              </li>
              <li>
                Isolation: Think of your test cases like mini science experiments.
                How do you run a science experiment? You limit your variables.
              </li>
              <li>
                Readability: When the test fails, do I know why?
              </li>
              <li>
                1-to-1: A single test should test a single thing.
                Overloaded tests are often brittle and it&rsquo;s difficult to get
                useful information out of them. There is a high cognitive load to
                sift through all the things being tested to find the one reason the test failed.

              small changes to the code under test.
            </p>
            <p>
              Brittleness can mean that you are not properly abstracting your
              tests or that you are testing too many implementation details.

              For example, if you are testing a webpage, do you necessarily need to test
              that all the right CSS classses were added to an element? Or is it sufficient
              to test that the right DOM elements exist and are visible?
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are testing a function, do you necessarily care which helper functions
              it calls, or is it sufficient that you get the right result or side-effect?

              Maybe you do care about the details. But you should expect that
              this will result in a test suite that requires more care.

            <h2>Test Story</h2>
            <p>
              I was once at a TX JS conference, during which a developer from Stripe
              discussed how they had componentized their UI styles. This was a major
              re-work, but it cut down their CSS definitions considerably.
              More importantly, it created a unified look-and-feel across their app
              and made it easier to override certain styles for white-labelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              The way they tested new widgets was to check that those widgets used certain
              classes. Although this would generally be considered an approach to avoid,
              Stripe used it successfully to ensure that widgets were using the new,
              componentized style library.

              Some testing approaches or frameworks have a certain degree of
              inherent brittleness in them. This is especially true for end-to-end
              tests or tests that have to touch multiple systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>That does not mean that these tests should be avoided&mdash;
              many times they provide valuable information about the overall
              health of a system&mdash;</em> but you should understand that they come
              at a price. You should be able to weigh the benefits and costs of
              these approaches and frameworks.

            <h2>Side note on Selenium</h2>
            <p>
              Selenium can be a powerful testing tool, but browsers are a crazy
              place full of events and asynchronicity.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a whole set of best practices for Selenium that we won&rsquo;t
              get into here, but one common and avoidable issue that crops up
              in Selenium test suites is <span class="keyword">improper abstraction</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Separating <span class="keyword">page objects</span> that handle
              interactions with the actual DOM elements from the main test cases
              will go a long way to more maintainable Selenium suites.
            </p>
            <p>
              (The other common issue is not waiting for elements to be visible,
              clickable, or interactable before trying to view, click, or
              interact with them. Remember: you&rsquo;re in a browser, and
              it&rsquo;s a jungle out there.)

              A test may be said to be <span class="keyword">flakey</span> when
              it fails randomly (<span class="keyword">rando-fails</span>) or needs to be
              re-run another time or two for it to pass.
            </p>
            <p>
              Flakey tests are a common reason developers dislike or distrust testing.
              This is especially true when the the test sometimes fails even though
              no remotely related code has been changed.

            <h3>Left-over State</h3>
            <p>
              One test case leaves behind state that messes up other tests.
              One indicator: if a test passes when run by itself, but fails
              when run as part of the test file or suite.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Fix: Figure out which test is leaving behind state and update it
              to clean up what it created in the test.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many testing libraries allow
              you to specify <span class="mono">afterEach</span> and
              <span class="mono">afterAll</span> functions, where you can do
              any kind of cleanup you need to do. These are also called
              <span class="keyword">tear down</span> functions. This is the ideal place to do
              this cleanup because if a test fails or is interrupted, it may not
              clean its state.

            <h3>Relying on outside systems</h3>
            <p>
              Any time you have to call out to a system that is not part of the
              test suite (especially if it is over the wire), you are opening yourself
              up to a certain level of flakiness (depending on the system and your approach).
            </p>
            <p>
              You have now coupled your test to that other system,
              and if it&rsquo;s having issues or the internet is bad or the planets are misaligned,
              you will have a failing test and (probably) a failing build.

            <h3>Relying on outside systems</h3>
            <p>
              The first question you should ask yourself is if you even need the test you
              are writing.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, I once ran into a test that was checking if
              a service class could connect to AWS. Because the service class was using
              AWS&rsquo;s library, they were essentially testing if the AWS client jar worked.

            <h3>Relying on outside systems</h3>
            <p>
              Otherwise, the most common approach is to
              <span class="keyword">mock</span> the service or system that the code
              under test will be hitting. (And you may want to
              have both mocked and unmocked tests for a connected service.)
            </p>
            <p>
              This means, of course, you will have to have written your code in a way
              that allows for this level of abstraction (e.g. a class takes in a
              connection as input to its constructor instead of building the connection itself);
              or you will need the ability to override the connection information
              at some level of the test suite.
            </p>
            <p>
              The benefits:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You have total control over what gets returned so you can be precise in your testing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You are no longer relying on another system! High five!
                </li>

            <h3>Relying on outside systems</h3>
            <p>
              Sometimes you want to (or have to) hit the real deal. One way to
              minimize the amount of flakiness is to have an instance of that system
              or service on the box that is running the tests
              (e.g. local instance or instance on a remote test box).
            </p>
            <p>
              This avoids a whole class of connectivity issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              This approach is common with tests that touch databases.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another potential approach to databases is to use something like h2,
              which creates a database in memory to run the test suite against.
              Naturally, there are pros and cons to this approach.
              Test suites of this nature often take much longer
              to run and the test box will need to be beefier.
              It is also possible (probable?) that you will not catch database-specific bugs (oh, MySQL).

            <h3>Rounding / Deltas</h3>
            <p>
              There are occassions where a successful result is anything within
              a certain acceptable range (e.g. latitude and longitude coordinates,
              fuzzy numerical calculations, timestamps).
            </p>
            <p>
              In these cases, you <s>may</s> will probably see random test failures
              because the original test is looking for a specific value.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some testing libraries have helper functions to check if a
              value exists in a given range (you can also grab helper libraries like Hamcrest).
              If you don&rsquo;t have that out of the box, inbd: you can roll
              your own with greater than and less than checks.

            <p>
              If you&rsquo;re like me and this phrase made no sense to you the first
              time you heard it: syntactic sugar refers to all the nice helper
              functionality that makes your tests easier to write and read.
            </p>
            <p>
              E.g., Hamcrest is a library you can use to sprinkle some
              syntactic sugar on your JUnit tests.

            <p>
              Sometimes a flakey test is telling you something useful about the code under test.
              It is possible that it has a race condition in it.
            </p>
            <p>
              You shouldn&rsquo;t start with that assumption, but it&rsquo;s a possibility.

              These are nasty to track down and not always easy to fix, so if this

            <p>
              Any time you have randomness or non-determinism in your test suite,
              you are opening yourself up to flakiness.
            </p>
            <p>
              For most purposes, a set of well-chosen test data will cover all
              necessary cases, and there is no need for random data.

            <h3>Non-determinism in code under test</h3>
            <p>
              There are very rare occassions where you are trying to test something
              that is inherently non-deterministic (e.g. a machine learning algorithm).
            </p>
            <p>
              On these very rare occassions, you might consider other approaches to testing.
              For example: running the test multiple times, aggregating the results,
              and looking for a value in a certain range.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is also very possible that these algorithms might need a human being to look
              at the results.

              A single change requires a lot of test updates

            <p>
              This is usually a sign of poor test isolation or too many tests.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ideally, each test should test one thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best thing you can do in this case is to take an inventory
              of the test cases you have had to change and see if there are
              ways of paring them down.
            </p>
            <p>
              In your everyday development cycle, when you are updating and
              especially if you are removing functionality, see if there are any
              test cases that no longer make sense given your changes.
              Regular test pruning is good for the overall health of your test suite.

              Tests need a lot of setup
            </h2>
            <p>
              The other depressingly common reason why tests might need a lot of setup
              is that they were written in a way unfriendly to testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              This can be indicative of other problems, but the best way to avoid
              this issue is to <em>write the tests before the code</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, I once worked in an Angular code base where almost all of the
              business logic was embedded in the controllers. That meant that even if you
              wanted to test a small function, you needed to set up a full instance of the
              controller with all of its dependencies and requisite state. The task was
              so burdensome (and in some cases downright impossible) that 90% of that
              code base was never covered by automated tests.
            </p>
            <p>
              Heavy controllers is an anti-pattern.
