              Cool, so what&rsquo;s this automated testing thing?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Automated tests are pieces of code that run your original code.
            </p>
            <p>
              They can be very specific and only test a function or a part of a function,
              or they can be coarse-grained and test an actual end-to-end scenario.
            </p>
            <p>
              The real power of any kind of automated test is that is <em>automated</em>&mdash; it's a piece of code and you can do some cool stuff with it.

            </h2>
            <h3>Minimize or prevent regressions</h3>
            <p>
              This applies to testing more broadly, but it deserves to be said explicitly:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The only way to know if your code work is to test it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Just because you tested it by hand doesn't mean you hit all the edge cases.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your code working when you tested it at the time of writing it does not mean it works now.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- <p>
              If you want to make sure your code works, you need to test it.
              Just because your code worked yesterday or even this morning doesn't
              mean that's true by the time it's pushed to prod.
              It doesn't even mean that it works in all expected cases.
              Especially when testing manually or when we feel under pressure to
              get something out, it's hard to think critically about where the
              rough edges and boundary cases are.

            <ul>
              <li>
                It's nerve-wracking to try to fix code when you're not sure if you'll break something in the process.
              </li>
              <li>
                This is especially true if the code you're changing is significantly complex (i.e. actually worth anything).
              </li>
              <li>
                So people usually don't clean it up. This is one very real reason for <strong>code rot</strong>.
                (It is <em>not</em> a coincidence that often the most important pieces of code are the ugliest.)

              Most testing libraries also allow you to set things up so your tests will run every time you make a code change.

                If you get used to doing that, it's easy to believe that code quality issues aren't your problem (spoiler: they are).

              <li>
                It's also easy to get sloppy because you expect someone else will find and/or fix your bugs for you.

              <li>
                This depends on your team, but ideally, this responsibility is shared, either amongst your team or a subset of your team.

                This takes a certain mindset, but developing that mindset will make you a better engineer and more generally, a better problem solver.

                RED: Because you've written the test <em>before</em> the code, the test should fail.
                You also need to make sure the test fails in the way you expect.
                Bonus points for making sure you get a useful error message when it fails.
              </li>
              <li>
                GREEN: Fix the test by writing the necessary code.
              </li>
              <li>
                REFACTOR: Once the test passes, take another look at the code and see if you can make
                it prettier. Because you have the test there as your safety net, you're assured you'll
                know if your refactor breaks anything.

            <ul>
              <li>
                We don't always get clear-cut requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you write the test first, you have to know upfront exactly what's being asked of you, and that's ideal.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you can't write the test, you know you don't have enough clarity on what's been asked.
              </li>
              <li>
                You also know <em>where</em> you're missing clarity. You can take that information back to the appropriate people and work out what's needed before you waste development time.

            <h3>Only write what you need</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Related to clarifying the requirements is the idea of gold-plating.
                If we don't really know what's expected, we are likely to add extra code that doesn't really do anything.
              </li>
              <li>
                But extra code means extra complexity and more to maintain.
              </li>
              <li>
                Because you have a test, you can make sure you're only writing the code you
                need to solve the problem. If you think there's something you can get rid of, great.
                If the test still passes, you're golden.

            <h3>Squash bugs better &amp; faster</h3>
            <p>
              The first step of debugging an issue is to reproduce it.
              You can do that by writing a test! This is awesome because:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This helps to isolate the bug
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can fix the bug faster because you can reproduce it reliably and quickly
                </li>
                <li>
                  You have more confidence that you've really fixed the issue
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now that case is part of the test suite, so you are also assured that you won't have that regression again
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Being an even better developer</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In my experience, the very best coders have been TDDers.
              </li>
              <li>
                TDD requires an analytical mindset and certain degree of discipline, qualities that are not bad to have.
              </li>
              <li>
                Some of them can also be a little snooty, but so can Ruby devs, and we still love them... Well, most of them.

            <ul>
              <li>
                This is the traditional metric for test success: You measure how many lines of
                your code is tested by your test suite (there are tools for this).
              </li>
              <li>
                Just like trying to meet any metric for the sake meeting the metric,
                this has drawbacks.
              </li>
              <li>
                This can cause extra work or extra code for no tangible benefit.
                And just like with any metric, you can game the system.
              </li>
              <li>
                My advice: Make sure you're testing what your users will use.
                If your code base is tight, then you will have a high test coverage percentage as a matter of course.
