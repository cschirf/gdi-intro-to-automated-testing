            <h3>Minimize or prevent regressions</h3>
            <p>
              This applies to testing more broadly, but it deserves to be said explicitly:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The only way to know if your code work is to test it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Just because you tested it by hand doesn&rsquo;t mean you hit all the edge cases.
                <!-- manual testing is labourious and time-intensive and we often don't test exhaustively because of this -->
              </li>
              <li>
                Also, just because your code worked when you tested it by hand that one time does not mean it works now.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- <p>
              If you want to make sure your code works, you need to test it.
              Just because your code worked yesterday or even this morning doesn&rsquo;t
              mean that's true by the time it's pushed to prod.
              It doesn&rsquo;t even mean that it works in all expected cases.
              Especially when testing manually or when we feel under pressure to
              get something out, it's hard to think critically about where the
              rough edges and boundary cases are.

                It&rsquo;s nerve-wracking to try to fix code when you&rsquo;re not sure if you&rsquo;ll break something
                in the process.
              </li>
              <li>
                This is especially true if the code you&rsquo;re changing is significantly complex/important.
              </li>
              <li>
                So people usually don&rsquo;t clean it up. This is one very real reason for <span class="keyword"><strong>code rot</strong></span>.
                (It is <em>not</em> a coincidence that the most important pieces of code are often the

              </li>
              <li>
                It also makes it easier to sell updating parts of the codebase if you can show you will have a high degree
                of confidence that customers will not get broken code.

              <li>

                When you write the test first, you have to know upfront exactly what's being asked of you, and that's

            <h3>Only write what you need</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Related to clarifying the requirements is the idea of gold-plating. If we don&rsquo;t really know what's
                expected, we are likely to add extra code that doesn&rsquo;t really do anything.
              </li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Because you have a gauge to determine when you&rsquo;re done (the tests), you only write as much as you
                need to to get the tests to pass. No more, no less.

            <p>
              The first step of debugging an issue is to reproduce it. You can do that by writing a test! This is awesome
              because:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This helps to isolate the bug
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can fix the bug faster because you can reproduce it reliably and quickly
                </li>
                <li>
                  You have more confidence that you&rsquo;ve really fixed the issue
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now that case is part of the test suite, so you are also assured that you won&rsquo;t have that regression
                  again

                This is the traditional metric for test success: You measure how many lines of your code is tested by

                This can cause extra work or extra code for no tangible benefit. And just like with any metric, you can

              So you&rsquo;ve tested all the edge cases? And it will work in all environments that way? A week from

              Active code bases are constantly in flux. How can you expect to ensure your code will always work as

              This part of the code is really untestable though.

            <p>
              There may very well be times that a piece of code cannot be unit or even integration test because of
              how it was originally written. But you can still write an end-to-end test for it.

              We used to test but the tests kept randomly failing.
            </h2>
            <p>
              This is a major red flag. Unreliable tests are worse than no tests. Flakey tests may indicate real bugs
              in the code base (like concurrency issues or race conditions). It can also arise from someone
              writing poor tests or not understanding the testing framework very well (e.g. selenium).
